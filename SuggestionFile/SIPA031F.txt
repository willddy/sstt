Tear down session attack can be launched on SIP implementation. A attacker tears down a SIP session between two UAs by sending his own CANCEL/BYE request to the UAs through proxy. Suggestion: Using basic or digest authentication for CANCEL/BYE requests. This guarantees that the request originates from a source that knows the secret and that the request method has not been changed.
