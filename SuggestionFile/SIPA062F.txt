Denial of service (DoS) attack with INVITE message flooding can be launched on SIP implementation. UAs will keep ringing with flooding of INVITE messages. Suggestion: It is very hard to protect against this type of attack, because authentication will prevent the annoying phone signals but does not protect against the actual attack. Access control list can be used in the UA side to filter incoming calls.
